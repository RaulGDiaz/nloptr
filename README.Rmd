[**nloptr**](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/) is an R interface to [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a free/open-source library for nonlinear optimization started by Steven G. Johnson, providing a common interface for a number of different free optimization routines available online as well as original implementations of various other algorithms. It can be used to solve general nonlinear programming problems with nonlinear constraints and lower and upper bounds for the controls, such as

$$ \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \quad f(x), $$

s.t. $g(x) \le 0$, $h(x) = 0$ and $\ell \le x \le u$.

The [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library is available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and the copyrights are owned by a variety of authors. See the [website](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Citing_NLopt/) for information on how to cite NLopt and the algorithms you use.

## Installation

### Installing [CMake](https://cmake.org)

The [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library has switched to [CMake](https://cmake.org) for its build system. Consequently, we updated the [**nloptr**](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/) package accordingly. This means that [CMake](https://cmake.org) is now a system requirement. You can install it by following [CMake installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/).

The important thing is that you add the [CMake](https://cmake.org) binary to your `PATH`:

- On Windows, the installer has an option to modify the system `PATH` environment variable. If that is not selected, please select it.
- On macOS, you can install [CMake](https://cmake.org) and then run it. In the menu bar, there is an item *How to Install For Command Line Use* which you can click on to have proper instructions on how to update your `PATH`. Note that the location of the [CMake](https://cmake.org) binary is always `/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake`. Hence, [**nloptr**](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/) knows where to find it even if you do not update your `PATH`.
- On Linux, it will be automatically added unless you specifically change the default installation directory before building [CMake](https://cmake.org).

Alternatively, you can set an environment variable `CMAKE_BIN` pointing to a [CMake](https://cmake.org) binary of your liking on your computer for [**nloptr**](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/) to use.

### Installing [**nloptr**](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/)

You can install [**nloptr**](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/) from CRAN using:
```
install.packages("nloptr")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub:
```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("astamm/nloptr")
```

The latest version 2.7.0 of the [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library will then be automatically built using [CMake](https://cmake.org).

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to [Dirk Eddelbuettel](https://github.com/eddelbuettel), Uwe Ligges and [Jelmer Ypma](https://github.com/jyypma) for the very instructive discussions about the pros and cons of various build strategies in R packages.
